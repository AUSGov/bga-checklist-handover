                        <h2>Design Notes</h2>
                        <h3>Important functionality</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The checklist needs to be a repeatable pattern. Content authors need to be able to create new checklists.</li>

                            <li>The user needs to be able leave and return to the checklist page and have their checkbox progress saved. Ideally the checkbox tick is saved in a cookie so user progress is still in place across sessions.</li>

                            <li>External links within the checklist items should open in the same tab.</li>

                            <li>The green tick for a step only displays when all the grey ticks in a step are done.</li>

                            <li>When a step is closed, any sub-steps underneath them are automatically closed too.</li>

                            <li>The "Must do" tags are required for all checkable items. The grey "Tip" items are not checkable and should not have this tag.</li>

                            <li>The save progress link (that appears in the pop-up modal) is placed in a text box.&nbsp;Overflow on long links is hidden. To avoid the user copying part of the link instead of the whole link the following is implemented:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The link text field has a small gradient effect at the end where long text overflows the container. This is to subtly indicate that the link is longer than what is visible.</li>
                                    <li>When the user clicks on the link text field (or it is in focus) the whole link is automatically selected using javascript.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Text in the accordion items is styled as per the demo. The default styling for these boxes is the standard BGA <a href="https://ausgov.github.io/bga-design-system/foundations/typography.html">body copy styles</a>. </li>

                            <li>Links in accordion items should be purple once visited as per the standard BGA <a href="https://ausgov.github.io/bga-design-system/foundations/buttons-and-links.html">in-text link styles</a>.</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Desirable functionality</h3>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ideally, when the user returns to the checklist page after clicking on a link the page retains where they were up to (e.g the accordion that was open is still open and the scrollpoint is the same).</li>

                        </ul>
